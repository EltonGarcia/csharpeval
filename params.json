{"name":"Csharpeval","tagline":"C# Expression Evaluator","body":"C# does not include a built-in method to evaluate a string during runtime, like Javascript's eval() or VBScript's Eval().\r\n\r\nExpressionEvaluator is a lightweight, simple and free library capable of parsing and compiling simple to medium complexity C# expressions. It features a Antlr-based tokenizer and parser and generates a LINQ Expression tree which is then compiled into a function.\r\n\r\nApplications for an expression parser and compiler are usually in the form of embedded code or user-defined expressions that need to be executed against runtime objects. \r\n\r\n# How can I use this library?\r\n\r\n* An [Experimental Music Compiler](http://www.windowsphone.com/en-us/store/app/experimental-music-compiler/370af565-51c8-4cd0-af6a-32d1e9a6690a) for Windows Mobile\r\n* Dynamic data-bound XML templates\r\n* User-defined conditional code stored in configuration files\r\n* Customer-defined queries\r\n* User-defined execution parameters for pluggable controls\r\n\r\nIf you have downloaded and used this library, I'd like to know about it's usage! Feel free to [let me know about it](https://www.codeplex.com/site/users/contact/rupertavery?OriginalUrl=https://csharpeval.codeplex.com).\r\n\r\n# NuGet\r\n\r\nExpression Evaluator is now available via [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/ExpressionEvaluator)\r\n\r\n# Getting Started\r\n\r\nSee **Usage** and **Sample Expressions** under [Documentation](https://csharpeval.codeplex.com/documentation)\r\n\r\n# Latest Updates\r\n\r\nFor more details see [Updates]\r\n\r\n# Features\r\n\r\n* *Compute*: Arithmetic operators: +- * / % ^\r\n* *Compare*: Relational operators: == != < > <= >=\r\n* *Assign*: Set values with the = operator\r\n* *Test*: Logical Operators: ! & | (bitwise logic) and && || (short circuit logic)\r\n* Expression grouping with parentheses ( )\r\n* Index accessors {\"[ ]\"}\r\n* Supports *dynamic* objects (including classes that implement *IDynamicMetaObjectProvider* such as *ExpandoObject*)\r\n* Context: Register and access external types and symbols through the *TypeRegistry*\r\n* Strings: (enclosed in '_single quotes_' and string concatenation with +)\r\n* _true_, _false_, _null_ literals\r\n* Declarative typing of numbers using d/f/m/l/u/ul suffixes\r\n* Implicit conversion of numerical expressions\r\n* Member access operator (.) for any valid expression.  Access properties, fields and methods of types, objects and expressions\r\n* Pre-registered default types e.g. bool, int, double, float, char, string\r\n* Supports nested function calls (x.method(y.method(z.method()), y.method2()))\r\n\r\n# Donate\r\n\r\nExpression Evaluator is 100% free, but if you would like to support the project in any way please do so.\r\n\r\n[![Donate](https://www.paypalobjects.com/webstatic/en_US/btn/btn_donate_cc_147x47.png)](https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_donations&business=rupert.avery@gmail.com&lc=PH&item_name=Expression Evaluator&currency_code=USD&bn=PP-DonationsBF:btn_donateCC_LG.gif:NonHosted)\r\n\r\n# Disclaimer\r\n\r\nThis is *not* a fully C#-compliant compiler, and as such features may be missing and there may be bugs or discrepancies in how the parser and compiler work.
