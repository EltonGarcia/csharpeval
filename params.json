{"name":"C# Expression Evaluator","tagline":"Parse and Compile C# Expressions During Runtime. Embed Logic. ","body":"Expression Evaluator is a lightweight, easy-to-use and free library capable of parsing and compiling C# expressions at runtime.\r\n\r\nC# does not have a built-in mechanism to evaluate a string during runtime, like Javascript's eval() or VBScript's Eval(). Expression Evaluator allows you to take a string that contains a C# expression, statement or set of statements, parse and compile it into a delegate function that you can call from your code. \r\n\r\nYou can also register types or instances of classes to access their properties and methods (static or instance), allowing you to dynamically interact with those objects.\r\n\r\n# How can I use this library?\r\n\r\n* An [Experimental Music Compiler](http://www.windowsphone.com/en-us/store/app/experimental-music-compiler/370af565-51c8-4cd0-af6a-32d1e9a6690a) for Windows Mobile\r\n* Dynamic data-bound XML templates\r\n* User-defined conditional code stored in configuration files\r\n* Customer-defined queries\r\n* User-defined execution parameters for pluggable controls\r\n* A Read-Eval-Print-Loop (REPL)\r\n\r\n# NuGet\r\n\r\nExpression Evaluator is available on [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/ExpressionEvaluator)\r\n\r\n{{ \r\nPM> Install-Package ExpressionEvaluator\r\n}}\r\n\r\n# Features\r\n\r\n* Arithmetic operators: +- * / % ^\r\n* Relational operators: == != < > <= >=\r\n* Logical Operators: ! & | (bitwise logic) and && || (short circuit logic)\r\n* Expression grouping with parentheses ( )\r\n* Post increment and decrement operators ++ --\r\n* Property index accessors [ ]\r\n* Support for dynamics (e.g. ExpandoObject)\r\n* Strings: enclosed in 'single quotes' and string concatenation with +\r\n* true, false, null literals\r\n* Declarative typing of numbers using d/f/m/l/u/ul suffixes\r\n* Implicit conversion of numerical expressions\r\n* Member access operator (.) for any valid expression. Access properties, fields and methods of types, objects and expressions\r\n* Register types and objects as symbols. Access static methods on System types.\r\n* Nested function calls (x.method(y.method(z.method()), y.method2()))\r\n* object instantiation with the new keyword\r\n* If-then-else and switch statements\r\n* Compile multiple statements into an expression block\r\n* Local variables and var keyword\r\n* for/while/do loops, break and continue\r\n* foreach loops\r\n* Set the context for identifiers in an expression (ScopeCompile)\r\n\r\n# Disclaimer\r\n\r\nThis is *not* a fully C#-compliant compiler, and as such features may be missing and there may be bugs or discrepancies in how the parser and compiler work.\r\n\r\n# Donate\r\n\r\nExpression Evaluator is 100% free, but if you would like to support the project in any way please do so.\r\n\r\n[![Donate](https://www.paypalobjects.com/webstatic/en_US/btn/btn_donate_cc_147x47.png)](https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_donations&business=rupert.avery@gmail.com&lc=PH&item_name=Expression Evaluator&currency_code=USD&bn=PP-DonationsBF:btn_donateCC_LG.gif:NonHosted)\r\n\r\n[![E-iceblue](http://www.e-iceblue.com/components/com_affiliate/banners/3ca481a23a214e4c43b56861a904e189.gif)](http://www.e-iceblue.com/Spire.PDF/Spire.PDF-for-.NET.html?aff_id=96&amp;amp;banner_id=15)\r\n\r\n# License\r\n\r\n*The MIT License (MIT)*\r\n\r\nCopyright (c) 2015 David Khristepher Santos\r\n\r\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\r\n\r\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\r\n\r\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
